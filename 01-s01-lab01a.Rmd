## Where to Get Help

Learning R can take time. Please do not feel that you have to grasp everything right away and it is totally ok to copy and paste.

### Google

**"Never commit to memory what can be easily looked up in books"** 

Often people simply google what they want to achieve in R. For example, in preparing this tutorial I googled "how to run a linear mixed effects model in R" (as I did not know) and found the following [helpful tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/03/15/mixed-models.html){target="_blank"} which goes through all the steps. This is just one of many examples of resources that are available.

### Stackoverflow

[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is a website where you can ask for help on bits of coding that you are struggling with. You can search for commonly asked questions and responses.

Feel free to google any time.
