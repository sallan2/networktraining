The material is based on the data skills course for MSc students at the University of Glasgow. Find lots of useful resources here: https://gupsych.github.io/data_skills/01_intro.html Please take a look at these free open resources in your own time. 2.1.1 Setting Working Directory First things first, we will set the working directory. What this means is that we need to tell R where the files we need are located. Think of it just like when you have different projects, and you have seperate folders for each project e.g. research conducted in schools, research conducted in the community and so on. When working on R, it’s useful to have all the data sets and files you need in one folder. To set the working directory press session -&gt; set working directory -&gt; choose directory and then select the folder where the data sets we are working on are saved, and save this file in the same folder as well. In other words- make sure your data sets and scripts are all in the same folder. 2.1.2 Code RStudio generally has four panels: Current file, Console, Environment, and Viewer. You can think of the console as a place to try things out, and the file to write down ideas you want to stick around. Go to the console and type x &lt;- 1 + 5 x Notice how now the environment shows we have a Value x that is 6. We have just created a variable. In the above, we would say “the variable x is assigned to 1 + 5” or “x gets 1 + 5” 2.1.3 Functions &amp; Arguments We have already created some code. But what does it all mean? Functions in R execute specific tasks and normally take a number of arguments (if you’re into linguistics you might want to think as these as verbs that require a subject and an object). You can look up all the arguments that a function takes by using the help documentation by using the format ?function. Some arguments are required, and some are optional. Optional arguments will often use a default (normally specified in the help documentation) if you do not enter any value. As an example, let’s look at the help documentation for the function rnorm() which randomly generates a set of numbers with a normal distribution. Just like the numbers in the graph below. Open up R Studio and in the console, type the following code: ?rnorm The help documentation for rnorm() should appear in the bottom right help panel. In the usage section, we see that rnorm() takes the following form: rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1) In the arguments section, there are explanations for each of the arguments. n is the number of observations we want to create, mean is the mean of the data points we will create and sd is the standard deviation of the set. In the details section it notes that if no values are entered for mean and sd it will use a default of 0 and 1 for these values. Because there is no default value for n it must be specified otherwise the code won’t run. Now, try running the above code for 50 participants with a mean test score of 3 and a standard deviation of 1. Remember we are asking R to create random numbers here, so do not worry if someone else has slightly different values. I need a hint! n in this case would be changed to 50. mean should be changed to 3 rnorm(50, mean = 3, sd = 1) now, try running the above code and see what happens. 2.1.4 Tidyverse However, we do not always want to use R to create random numbers, we want to use it to analyse our own data which commonly resides in .csv or .sav files. People have developed many different libraries to help us work with such data. One of the most popular packages is tidyverse. The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages with a common design , grammar, and data structure that makes analysis faster and easier. The first time you want to use a package, you must first install the package. tidyverse can be installed as follows. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Once the package has been installed, any time you want to use the package you use the following code. If you want to open a package other than tidyverse, simply substitute the package name. 2.1.5 Keeping Environment Clean As you work, you will notice your environment will fill up with lots of variables that you have assigned. Before beginning any new analyses it is important to clear the environment which can be done with the following code. If you run this code R will forget any libraries that you have loaded, such as tidyverse. rm(list = ls()) "],
["network-analysis.html", "Session 3 Network Analysis 3.1 Overview 3.2 Background 3.3 Why Use Network Analysis in Mental Health? 3.4 What is a network?", " Session 3 Network Analysis 3.1 Overview This session will cover the basics of network analysis approach. Check the references section for more advanced topics. 3.2 Background Recent thinking conceptulises mental wellbeing as comprising of environmental, psychological and social factors, a challenge to static factor models. Psychologists wishing to study the dynamic interaction of many factors may wish to consider a complexity science perspective such as network analysis. The potential utility of network analysis was noted over ten years ago in intelligence research. The frequently reported patterns of positive correlations between various cognitive tasks (e.g. verbal comprehension and working memory) are typically explained in terms of a dominant latent factor, i.e. the correlations reflect a hypothesised common factor of general intelligence (g). However, van der Maas (2006) and colleagues argued that this empirical pattern can also be accounted for by means of a network approach (see image below), wherein the patterns of positive relationships can be explained using a mutualism model, i.e. the variables have mutual, reinforcing, relationships (Hevey, 2018) The image above from van der Maas (2006) demonstrates the difference between a latent factor and a network approach. 3.3 Why Use Network Analysis in Mental Health? “Analysis of mental health data is usually based on sum-scores of symptoms or the estimation of factor models. Both types of analyses disregard direct associations among symptoms that are well-understood in clinical practice: mental disorders can be conceptualized as vicious circles of problems that are hard to escape. A novel research framework, the network perspective on psychopathology, understands mental disorders as complex networks of interacting symptoms” (Fried, 2018) 3.4 What is a network? A network is a set of nodes connected by a set of edges. A network (as collection of various nodes and edges) is also sometimes known as a graph. Several packages are used in the network analysis, including network, statnet, igraph and qgraph. qgraph was developed in the context of psychometrics approach by Dr. Sacha Epskamp and colleagues in 2012. We will be be working with qgraph. Please install.packages(&quot;qgraph&quot;) so we can get started. "],
["practical.html", "Session 4 Practical 4.1 Description of Data 4.2 Visualising Data 4.3 Visualising Data - Practical 4.4 Working With Data 4.5 Plotting Data 4.6 Recoding Factors", " Session 4 Practical 4.1 Description of Data We will work with a local dataset gathered from high school age children. Please download the .csv file HERE (you might need to right click and choose save as). First, we need to make sure we have tidyverse loaded and then open the file. We are creating a data frame called which we will assign to our .csv file. Remember, this needs to be saved within the working directory that you set so that R knows where to find it. library(tidyverse) data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;networkdataset.csv&quot;) R has the str() function which lets us look at the structure of data. Look at str(data) As we can see, Gender, Place and Grade are listed as character data (words), this is not accurate and it would be better to let R know these data are factors. data_factors &lt;- data %&gt;% mutate(Gender = as.factor(Gender), Place = as.factor(Place), Grade = as.factor(Grade), Familyarrangement = as.factor(Familyarrangement), Average = as.factor(Average), educationFather = as.factor(educationFather), educationMather = as.factor(educationMather)) Now, if we run str(data_factors) we can see that this dataframe is recognised as factors. 4.2 Visualising Data To do - write a bit about plotting options in R. 4.3 Visualising Data - Practical How many females and males? The # symbol in the code is a comment. Comments do not add anything to the code but are there for human understanding to explain what is happening in the code. Look at the comments in the code below to understand what is going on. # we are telling R we want to plot dat, we are letting R know Gender # is a factor on our x axis and we want to fill with colour ggplot(data_factors, aes(x = Gender, fill = Gender)) + # we are choosing a bar plot geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = .8) + # we are naming the x scale scale_x_discrete(name = &quot;Gender&quot;) + # we are chosing a colour scheme from pre-exising options scale_fill_viridis_d(option = &quot;D&quot;) + # we are naming the y scale scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Number of participants&quot;) Figure 4.1: Participant Gender 4.4 Working With Data Participants rated themselves on 23 items of the TEQ questionnaire which asked about exposure to different traumatic events. We would like to create a plot to visualise the total TEQ and where participants live. However, we need to clean the data a little bit first. We will explain each line in the code below. The pipe operator %&gt;% is something you will see a lot and (in terms of code) means “and then” we create a new dataframe called total_TEQ which we assign to our new code we then use select, the . lets R know we are still working with the same dataframe. We then select all TEQ variables, Pcode and Place select(., TEQ1:TEQ23, Pcode, Place gather tranforms the data from wide to long. We only want it to do this to TEQ variables so we can drop -Pcode and -Place using the minus sign. We then use group_by(Pcode, Place) as we want to look at scores for each participant and where they live Finally summarise(tot_TEQ = sum(score)) creates a column named tot_TEQ which has the total TEQ score for each participant. total_TEQ &lt;- data_factors %&gt;% select(., TEQ1:TEQ23, Pcode, Place) %&gt;% gather(&quot;var&quot;, &quot;score&quot;, -Pcode, -Place) %&gt;% group_by(Pcode, Place) %&gt;% summarise(tot_TEQ = sum(score)) 4.5 Plotting Data Now we can visualise total_TEQ. When visualising differences between groups in numerical values, people have historically used bar graphs. There is currently a shift taking place, with people moving away from bar graphs, and towards more informative visualisations. Before we used geom_bar() to create a barplot and this time we will use geom_violin() to create a violin plot. In the violin plot, the width of the area indicates the density of the data at that point on the y axis. We have also included a box plot using geom_boxplot within this graph to show another option. ggplot(total_TEQ, aes(x = as.factor(Place), fill = as.factor(Place), y = tot_TEQ)) + geom_violin(show.legend = FALSE, trim = TRUE, alpha = 0.8) + geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) + scale_y_continuous(name = &quot;Total TEQ&quot;) + scale_x_discrete(name = &quot;Place&quot;) Figure 4.2: TEQ Scores From looking at the graph we just created, what location tends to have highest TEQ? Village Camp City 4.6 Recoding Factors The original file has Camp, city, Village. It might be neater to have Camp, City, Village. We can easily recode the city level of the Place factor using the following code. total_TEQ &lt;- total_TEQ %&gt;% mutate(Place = recode(Place, city = &quot;City&quot;)) "],
