How to install R How to open files. How to maniuplate data and save scripts. 1.1.1 What is R? For network analysis, you need two different bits of software, R and RStudio. R is a programming language that you will write code in and R Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes working with R easier. 1.1.2 Base R Install base R from https://cran.rstudio.com/. Choose the download link for your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows). 1.1.3 R Studio Go to https://rstudio.com and download the RStudio Desktop (Open Source License) version for your operating system under the list titled Installers for Supported Platforms. 1.1.4 Advantages of using R Quickfire Questions We have put questions throughout to help you test your knowledge. When you type in or choose the correct answer, the dashed box will change color and become solid green. From the following options, how do you get R on your machine? Installing Base R &amp; R Studio Installing R Studio Installing Base R Explain This Answer! R is the basic package. R Studio is an add-on that make R much easier to use. "],

The material is based on the data skills course for MSc students. Find lots and lots of useful resources here: https://gupsych.github.io/data_skills/01_intro.html Please take a look at these resources in your own time. 2.1.1 Setting Working Directory First things first, we have to set our Working Directory to the place our file is. In RStudio we do this by hitting ‘Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Source File Location’. This lets us interact with other files that are outside of our current script (and keeps our project nice and tidy). 2.1.2 Code RStudio generally has four panels: Current file, Console, Environment, and Viewer. You can think of the console as a place to try things out, and the file to write down ideas you want to stick around. Go to the console and type x &lt;- 1 + 5 x Notice how now the environment shows we have a Value x that is 6. We have just created a variable. In the above, we would say “the variable x is assigned to 1 + 5” or “x gets 1 + 5” "],

Psychologists wishing to study all of these factors together may wish to consider a complexity science perspective such as network analysis. 3.3 What is a network? A network is a set of nodes connected by a set of edges. Several packages are used in the network analysis, including network, statnet, igraph and qgraph. qgraph was developed in the context of psychometrics approach by Dr. Sacha Epskamp and colleagues in 2012. We will be be working with qgraph. "],
