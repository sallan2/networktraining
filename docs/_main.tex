\hypertarget{working-with-data-in-r}{%
\chapter{Working With Data in R}\label{working-with-data-in-r}}

\hypertarget{overview-2}{%
\section{Overview}\label{overview-2}}

This is a basic introduction to R. The material is based on the data skills course for MSc students at the University of Glasgow. Find lots of useful resources here: \url{https://gupsych.github.io/data_skills/01_intro.html}

Please take a look at these free open resources in your own time.

\hypertarget{setting-working-directory}{%
\subsection{Setting Working Directory}\label{setting-working-directory}}

First things first, we will set the working directory. What this means is that we need to tell R where the files we need are located. Think of it just like when you have different projects, and you have seperate folders for each project e.g.~research conducted in schools, research conducted in the community and so on. When working on R, it's useful to have all the data sets and files you need in one folder.

To set the working directory press session -\textgreater{} set working directory -\textgreater{} choose directory and then select the folder where the data sets we are working on are saved, and save this file in the same folder as well. In other words- make sure your data sets and scripts are all in the same folder.

\hypertarget{code}{%
\subsection{Code}\label{code}}

RStudio generally has four panels: Current file, Console, Environment, and Viewer. You can think of the console as a place to try things out, and the file to write down ideas you want to stick around. Go to the console and type

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x <-}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{1} \OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\DecValTok{5}
\NormalTok{x}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Notice how now the environment shows we have a Value x that is 6. We have just created a variable. In the above, we would say ``the variable x is assigned to 1 + 5'' or ``x gets 1 + 5''

\hypertarget{functions-arguments}{%
\subsection{Functions \& Arguments}\label{functions-arguments}}

We have already created some code. But what does it all mean?

Functions in R execute specific tasks and normally take a number of arguments (if you're into linguistics you might want to think as these as verbs that require a subject and an object). You can look up all the arguments that a function takes by using the help documentation by using the format \texttt{?function}. Some arguments are required, and some are optional. Optional arguments will often use a default (normally specified in the help documentation) if you do not enter any value.

As an example, let's look at the help documentation for the function rnorm() which randomly generates a set of numbers with a normal distribution. Just like the numbers in the graph below.

Open up R Studio and in the console, type the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{?rnorm}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The help documentation for \texttt{rnorm()} should appear in the bottom right help panel. In the usage section, we see that \texttt{rnorm()} takes the following form:

\begin{verbatim}
rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
\end{verbatim}

In the arguments section, there are explanations for each of the arguments. \texttt{n} is the number of observations we want to create, \texttt{mean} is the mean of the data points we will create and \texttt{sd} is the standard deviation of the set. In the details section it notes that if no values are entered for mean and sd it will use a default of 0 and 1 for these values. Because there is no default value for n it must be specified otherwise the code won't run.

Now, try running the above code for 50 participants with a mean test score of 3 and a standard deviation of 1.

Remember we are asking R to create \textbf{random} numbers here, so do not worry if someone else has slightly different values.

I need a hint!

\texttt{n} in this case would be changed to 50.

\texttt{mean} should be changed to 3

\texttt{rnorm(50,\ mean\ =\ 3,\ sd\ =\ 1)}

now, try running the above code and see what happens.

\hypertarget{tidyverse}{%
\subsection{Tidyverse}\label{tidyverse}}

However, we do not always want to use R to create random numbers, we want to use it to analyse our own data which commonly resides in .csv or .sav files. People have developed many different libraries to help us work with such data. One of the most popular packages is tidyverse.

The Tidyverse is a collection of R packages with a common design , grammar, and data structure that makes analysis faster and easier.

The first time you want to use a package, you must first install the package. \texttt{tidyverse} can be installed as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
install.packages("tidyverse")
\end{verbatim}

Once the package has been installed, any time you want to use the package you use the following code. If you want to open a package other than \texttt{tidyverse}, simply substitute the package name.

\hypertarget{keeping-environment-clean}{%
\subsection{Keeping Environment Clean}\label{keeping-environment-clean}}

As you work, you will notice your environment will fill up with lots of variables that you have assigned.

Before beginning any new analyses it is important to clear the environment which can be done with the following code. If you run this code R will forget any libraries that you have loaded, such as \texttt{tidyverse}.

\hypertarget{background}{%
\section{Background}\label{background}}

Recent thinking conceptulises mental wellbeing as comprising of environmental, psychological and social factors, a challenge to static factor models. Psychologists wishing to study the dynamic interaction of many factors may wish to consider a complexity science perspective such as network analysis.

\hypertarget{what-is-a-network}{%
\section{What is a network?}\label{what-is-a-network}}

A network is a set of nodes connected by a set of edges. A network (as collection of various nodes and edges) can be defined as a graph

Several packages are used in the network analysis, including \texttt{network}, \texttt{statnet}, \texttt{igraph} and \texttt{qgraph}.

qgraph was developed in the context of psychometrics approach by Dr.~Sacha Epskamp and colleagues in 2012. We will be be working with \texttt{qgraph}.

\hypertarget{practical}{%

\hypertarget{description-of-data}{%
\section{Description of Data}\label{description-of-data}}

We will work with a local dataset gathered from high school age children. Please download the .csv file \href{data/networkdataset.csv}{HERE} (you might need to right click and choose save as).

First, we need to make sure we have \texttt{tidyverse} loaded and then open the file. We are creating a data frame called which we will assign to our .csv file.

Remember, this needs to be saved within the working directory that you set so that R knows where to find it.

\hypertarget{working-with-data}{%
\section{Working With Data}\label{working-with-data}}

Participants rated themselves on 23 items of the TEQ questionnaire which asked about exposure to different traumatic events. We would like to create a plot to visualise the total TEQ and where participants live. However, we need to clean the data a little bit first. We will explain each line in the code below.

The pipe operator \%\textgreater{}\% is something you will see a lot and (in terms of code) means ``and then''

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  we create a new dataframe called \texttt{total\_TEQ} which we assign to our new code
\item
  we then use \texttt{select}, the . lets R know we are still working with the same dataframe. We then select all TEQ variables, Pcode and Place \texttt{select(.,\ TEQ1:TEQ23,\ Pcode,\ Place}
\item
  \texttt{gather} tranforms the data from wide to long. We only want it to do this to TEQ variables so we can drop \texttt{-Pcode} and \texttt{-Place} using the minus sign.
\item
  We then use \texttt{group\_by(Pcode,\ Place)} as we want to look at scores for each participant and where they live
\item
  Finally \texttt{summarise(tot\_TEQ\ =\ sum(score))} creates a column named tot\_TEQ which has the total TEQ score for each participant.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{total_TEQ <-}\StringTok{ }\NormalTok{data }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\KeywordTok{select}\NormalTok{(., TEQ1}\OperatorTok{:}\NormalTok{TEQ23, Pcode, Place) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\KeywordTok{gather}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"var"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"score"}\NormalTok{, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Pcode, }\OperatorTok{-}\NormalTok{Place) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\KeywordTok{group_by}\NormalTok{(Pcode, Place) }\OperatorTok{%>%}
\KeywordTok{summarise}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{tot_TEQ =} \KeywordTok{sum}\NormalTok{(score))}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{plotting-data}{%
\section{Plotting Data}\label{plotting-data}}

Now we can visualise \texttt{total\_TEQ}.

When visualising differences between groups in numerical values, people have historically used bar graphs. There is currently a shift taking place, with people moving away from bar graphs, and towards more informative visualisations.

Before we used \texttt{geom\_bar()} to create a barplot and this time we will use \texttt{geom\_violin()} to create a violin plot. In the violin plot, the width of the area indicates the density of the data at that point on the y axis. We have also included a box plot using \texttt{geom\_boxplot} within this graph to show another option.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{ggplot}\NormalTok{(total_TEQ, }\KeywordTok{aes}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{x =} \KeywordTok{as.factor}\NormalTok{(Place), }\DataTypeTok{fill =} \KeywordTok{as.factor}\NormalTok{(Place), }\DataTypeTok{y =}\NormalTok{ tot_TEQ)) }\OperatorTok{+}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{geom_violin}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{show.legend =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{trim =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{alpha =} \FloatTok{0.8}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{geom_boxplot}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{width =} \FloatTok{0.2}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{show.legend =} \OtherTok{FALSE}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{scale_y_continuous}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{name =} \StringTok{"Total TEQ"}\NormalTok{) }\OperatorTok{+}
\StringTok{  }\KeywordTok{scale_x_discrete}\NormalTok{(}\DataTypeTok{name =} \StringTok{"Place"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\caption{TEQ Scores}\label{fig:graph2}

\hypertarget{rstudio-cloud}{%
\chapter{RStudio Cloud}\label{rstudio-cloud}}

Sometimes R might not work well on our own computers. However, there is an online version of R Studio (R Studio Cloud) which can be used in a pinch. Using R Studio Cloud is a little different to R Studio, so we have made a short guide to get you up and running.

\hypertarget{creating-an-account}{%
\section{Creating an Account}\label{creating-an-account}}

Head to \href{https://rstudio.cloud/}{RStudio Cloud} and click ``Sign Up'' at the top of the page

Enter details you wish to sign in with and select ``Sign up''

You'll receive an e-mail at the address you sign up with, make sure to click the link to activate your account fully.

\hypertarget{accessing-rstudio-cloud}{%
\section{Accessing RStudio Cloud}\label{accessing-rstudio-cloud}}

Head back to \href{https://rstudio.cloud/}{RStudio Cloud} and select ``log In'', where we previously chose ``Sign Up''

Once logged in, you'll be taken to the ``Your Workspace'' page, this is where all of your RStudio Cloud projects will be accessible from

Select ``New Project'' and then ``New Project'' again

You will see the message ``Deploying Project'' for a couple of minutes while it creates your Workspace

\hypertarget{getting-started-with-rstudio-cloud}{%
\section{Getting Started with RStudio Cloud}\label{getting-started-with-rstudio-cloud}}

Once loaded, you'll see a page that looks almost identical to the other screenshots in the learning material

\hypertarget{naming-the-workspace}{%
\subsection{Naming the Workspace}\label{naming-the-workspace}}

Let's give the project a better name!

Click on ``Untitled Project'' at the top of the page

This will allow you to rename to whatever you like, in this case we'll go for ``Network Training''

Press the return key on your keyboard, or click on a different area on the page to complete the task

\hypertarget{uploading-files}{%
\subsection{Uploading Files}\label{uploading-files}}

Since this is on the web, files on your computer won't be immediately accessible to RStudio Cloud, you will need to upload them yourself

Click the ``Upload'' button on the Files tab

An ``Upload Files'' element will load up where you can click ``Browse'' and select the file(s) you wish to make available to RStudio Cloud

Once you have selected a file and chosen ``OK'', you'll be taken back to the main application and you will now see the file you uploaded

You can now interact with this file as described in the rest of the learning material!
