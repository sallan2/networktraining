## Description of Data

We will work with a local dataset gathered from high school age children. Please download the .csv file [HERE](data/networkdataset.csv) (you might need to right click and choose save as).

First, we need to make sure we have `tidyverse` loaded and then open the file. We are creating a data frame called which we will assign to our .csv file.

Remember, this needs to be saved within the working directory that you set so that R knows where to find it.


```r
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv("networkdataset.csv")
```

R has the `str()` function which lets us look at the structure of data. Look at `str(data)`

As we can see, Gender, Place and Grade are listed as character data (words), this is not accurate and it would be better to let R know these data are factors.


```r
data_factors <- data %>%
  mutate(Gender = as.factor(Gender),
         Place = as.factor(Place),
         Grade = as.factor(Grade),
         Familyarrangement = as.factor(Familyarrangement),
         Average = as.factor(Average),
         educationFather = as.factor(educationFather),
         educationMather = as.factor(educationMather))
```

Now, if we run `str(data_factors)` we can see that this dataframe is recognised as factors.

## Visualising Data

To do - write a bit about plotting options in R.

## Visualising Data - Practical

How many females and males?

The # symbol in the code is a comment. Comments do not add anything to the code but are there for human understanding to explain what is happening in the code. Look at the comments in the code below to understand what is going on.



```r
# we are telling R we want to plot dat, we are letting R know Gender 
# is a factor on our x axis and we want to fill with colour
ggplot(data_factors, aes(x = Gender, fill = Gender)) +
  # we are choosing a bar plot
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE, alpha = .8) +
  # we are naming the x scale
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Gender") +
  # we are chosing a colour scheme from pre-exising options
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "D") +
  # we are naming the y scale
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of participants")
```

## Working With Data

Participants rated themselves on 23 items of the TEQ questionnaire which asked about exposure to different traumatic events. We would like to create a plot to visualise the total TEQ and where participants live. However, we need to clean the data a little bit first. We will explain each line in the code below.

The pipe operator %>% is something you will see a lot and (in terms of code) means "and then"

1. we create a new dataframe called `total_TEQ` which we assign to our new code
2. we then use `select`, the . lets R know we are still working with the same dataframe. We then select all TEQ variables, Pcode and Place `select(., TEQ1:TEQ23, Pcode, Place`
3. `gather` tranforms the data from wide to long. We only want it to do this to TEQ variables so we can drop `-Pcode` and `-Place` using the minus sign.
4. We then use `group_by(Pcode, Place)` as we want to look at scores for each participant and where they live
5. Finally `summarise(tot_TEQ = sum(score))` creates a column named tot_TEQ which has the total TEQ score for each participant.



```r
total_TEQ <- data_factors %>%
select(., TEQ1:TEQ23, Pcode, Place) %>%
gather("var", "score", -Pcode, -Place) %>%
group_by(Pcode, Place) %>%
summarise(tot_TEQ = sum(score))
```

## Plotting Data

Now we can visualise `total_TEQ`. 

When visualising differences between groups in numerical values, people have historically used bar graphs. There is currently a shift taking place, with people moving away from bar graphs, and towards more informative visualisations.

Before we used `geom_bar()` to create a barplot and this time we will use `geom_violin()` to create a violin plot. In the violin plot, the width of the area indicates the density of the data at that point on the y axis. We have also included a box plot using `geom_boxplot` within this graph to show another option.



```r
ggplot(total_TEQ, aes(x = as.factor(Place), fill = as.factor(Place), y = tot_TEQ)) + geom_violin(show.legend = FALSE, trim = TRUE, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total TEQ") +
  scale_x_discrete(name = "Place")
```

}

\caption{TEQ Scores}(\#fig:graph2)
\end{figure}

From looking at the graph we just created, what location tends to have highest TEQ?

<select class='solveme' data-answer='["Camp"]'> <option></option> <option>Village</option> <option>Camp</option> <option>City</option></select>  

## Recoding Factors

The original file has Camp, city, Village. It might be neater to have Camp, City, Village. We can easily recode the city level of the Place factor using the following code.



```r
total_TEQ <- total_TEQ %>%
    mutate(Place = recode(Place, city = "City"))
```
