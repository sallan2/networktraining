# Network Analysis

## Overview

## Background

Recent thinking conceptulises mental wellbeing as comprising of environmental, psychological and social factors, a challenge to static factor models. Psychologists wishing to study the dynamic interaction of many factors may wish to consider a complexity science perspective such as network analysis.

The frequently reported patterns of positive correlations between various cognitive tasks (e.g. verbal comprehension and working memory) are typically explained in terms of a dominant latent factor, i.e. the correlations reflect a hypothesised common factor of general intelligence (g). However, van der Maas (2006) and colleagues argued that this empirical pattern can also be accounted for by means of a network approach (see image below), wherein the patterns of positive relationships can be explained using a mutualism model, i.e. the variables have mutual, reinforcing, relationships (Hevey, 2018)

## Why Use Network Analysis in Mental Health?

"Analysis of mental health data is usually based on sum-scores of symptoms or the estimation of factor models. Both types of analyses disregard direct associations among symptoms that are well-understood in clinical practice: mental disorders can be conceptualized as vicious circles of problems that are hard to escape. A novel research framework, the network perspective on psychopathology, understands mental disorders as complex networks of interacting symptoms" (Fried, 2018)

## What is a network?

A network is a set of nodes connected by a set of edges. A network (as collection of various nodes and edges) can be defined as a graph

Several packages are used in the network analysis, including `network`, `statnet`, `igraph` and `qgraph`.

qgraph was developed in the context of psychometrics approach by Dr. Sacha Epskamp and colleagues in 2012. We will be be working with `qgraph`.
